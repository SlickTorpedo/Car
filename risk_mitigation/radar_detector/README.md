# Radar Detector: Uniden R8

This page documents the installation and wiring details for the **Uniden R8 Radar Detector** in my 2000 Lexus GS300. The goal of this documentation is to provide a clear understanding of the setup, including the wiring process, routing, and troubleshooting.

---

## Overview

- **Model**: Uniden R8
- **Power Source**: Auxiliary power from the head unit area.
- **Fuse Protection**: Built into the cigarette lighter plug-in with a 2A fuse and PCB for power regulation.
- **Cable Routing**: Routed from the driver’s side footwell, through the weather stripping, and up to the radar detector.

## Components and Wiring

### **Cigarette Lighter Plug-In**
The radar detector is powered via a modified cigarette lighter plug-in:
- **[IMAGE COMING SOON]**
- This plug-in contains:
  - A **2A fuse** for protection.
  - A **PCB** for regulating power to the radar detector.
- The plug-in serves as a makeshift fuse holder.

### **RJ45 Cable**
- The power wires from the cigarette lighter plug-in are connected to a modified **RJ45 cable**.
- **Wiring Schematic**: Refer to the diagram here: [Radar Detector Wiring Schematic](https://www.rdforum.org/threads/74118/).
- **Connection Details**:
  - The cigarette lighter's power and ground wires are soldered to the stripped wires of the RJ45 cable.
  - Each connection is individually heat-shrunk.
  - The entire connection is then covered with a larger heat-shrink tube for additional protection.

## Cable Routing

### **Driver’s Side Footwell**
- The cable begins near the **left side of the driver’s foot area**, close to the **E-brake**.

### **Weather Stripping**
- The cable is routed into the **weather stripping** and runs along it until the end of the panel.
- Excess cable is bundled and secured in this area for future adjustments or maintenance.
- **[IMAGE COMING SOON]**

### **Windshield Panel**
- After reaching the end of the panel, the cable:
  - Turns toward the **area between the panel and the windshield**.
  - Exits the panel and drops down to the radar detector.

## Common Issue Testing

### **Step 1: Test the Radar Detector**
- Begin by testing the Uniden R8 on its own:
  - Use the provided cigarette lighter plug to power it directly.
  - Alternatively, fashion a simple test cable to provide 12V power to the radar detector.
- Confirm the radar detector itself is not malfunctioning or damaged.

### **Step 2: Check the Fuse in the Cigarette Lighter Plug**
- Remove the cigarette lighter plug and inspect the **2A fuse** inside.
- If the fuse is blown, replace it with a new 2A fuse.
- In the future, this setup will be replaced with a standard inline fuse holder for easier inspection.

### **Step 3: Verify Power at the Fuse Holder Input**
- Check for 12V accessory power going **into** the fuse holder.
- If no power is present:
  - The wire from the head unit area may be damaged.  
  - Trace the wire to its source and test for 12V there.

### **Step 4: Check the "Cigarette Lighter" Fuse in the Kick Panel**
- The accessory power source also runs through the **"Cigarette Lighter" fuse** in the driver-side kick panel.
- If this fuse is blown:
  - The following systems will also stop functioning:
    - **Head Unit**: Will fail to boot.
    - **Fast Charger**: Will not provide power.
    - **Amplifier**: Indicator light will not turn on.
    - **Safety Camera System**: Will not power on.
- Replace the fuse if necessary.

## Additional Notes
- The **"Cigarette Lighter" fuse** acts as a signal for "vehicle is on" power, not as a primary power source for most systems.
- Components like the fast charger, amplifier, and safety system use this signal to turn on but draw their primary power from dedicated battery connections.
- The radar detector is the **only component** directly powered by this signal.

## Future Updates
- Images of the setup, routing, and cable identification will be added when the car is back from the shop.
