Here’s a revised version of your README with additional structure and clarity:

Car

I’ve made a series of custom electronic modifications to my 2000 Lexus GS300 to improve sound, safety, utility, and functionality. This repository serves as documentation for all changes, helping others understand my system and providing a standard for future modifications. After experiencing an issue with the car’s electrics and handing it over to someone for repair, I realized they had no idea what was custom and what was stock. This repository addresses that gap.

Overview of Modifications

Sound
	•	Subwoofers: Two subwoofers in the trunk inside a custom-built box, connected to an amplifier under the passenger seat.
	•	Wiring: Direct connection to the battery for sufficient power.
	•	Head Unit: Retains the factory unit with added CarPlay and other modern features.

Risk Mitigation
	•	Radar Detector: A Uniden R8 radar detector.
	•	Wiring: Spliced into an RJ45 cable, connected to accessory power. Activates only when the car is on.

Utilities
	•	Fast Charger: Provides high-current charging for devices.
	•	Wiring: Directly connected to the battery for sufficient current without tripping factory fuses.
	•	Relay System: Includes relays connected to auxiliary power to ensure the charger is off when the car is off, preventing battery drain.
	•	Step-Down Transformer: Powers additional electronics.

Safety
	•	Dashcam / AI-Enabled Collision Detection Camera: A Raspberry Pi-powered system with a camera for lane detection and distance estimation.
	•	Functionality: Alerts the driver with sounds if objects in the lane are within a dangerous threshold.
	•	Power: Powered by the step-down transformer connected to the fast charger setup.

Component Descriptions

Subwoofers
	•	Location: Trunk, inside a custom-built enclosure.
	•	Amplifier: Installed under the passenger seat and connected directly to the car battery for sufficient power delivery.
	•	Head Unit: Factory-installed but upgraded for CarPlay and modern functionality.

Radar Detector
	•	Model: Uniden R8.
	•	Wiring: Custom RJ45 cable spliced to accessory power, ensuring it activates only when the car is running.

Fast Charger
	•	Purpose: High-current charging for devices.
	•	Wiring Details:
	•	Connected directly to the battery.
	•	Relays tied to auxiliary power prevent battery drain when the car is off.
	•	Includes a step-down transformer to power the Raspberry Pi.

Dashcam / AI-Enabled Camera
	•	Setup: A Raspberry Pi with a camera running lane detection and distance estimation algorithms.
	•	Safety Functionality: Alerts with sounds when objects fall within a dangerous threshold in the lane.
	•	Power Source: Powered via the step-down transformer from the fast charger system.

Goals for Standardization

This project aims to:
	1.	Document every modification clearly for maintenance and troubleshooting.
	2.	Establish wiring and component standards to ensure reliability and consistency.
	3.	Provide QR codes on custom components, linking to detailed documentation for each.
